# Orientation to the files in this repository

1. The .Rpres file is the source file used to generate the other files. R Markdown is used to embed R code with other text and to format the results as desired.
2. The .md file is formatted to be viewed here on GitHub. (**This is probably the best files to open for optimal formatting**)
